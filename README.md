## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I used Bootstrap and CSS with JS where BS's functions have failed me. Also used JS to mimic the validation of the form.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap 5.3
- Pure JavaScript

### What I learned

I got more confident with Bootstrap and learned how to add toast. However, toast close button wouldn't work until I just coded the behaviour with JS.

### Continued development

Try some other framework.
